GENERAL:
  > New and improved intro animation.
  > Fixed invalid laps being counted as best laps.

TYRES:
  > Fixed app horizontally flipping not in the center of the screen if ui_scale is above 100%.
  > Fixed temperature data being incorrectly reported as missing for cars that have tyre compounds that never reach 100% grip (most notably all cars in RSS GT Legends Championship Pack).

  > Optimized apps. About 25% speedup, with less fluctuations.

MAP:
  > Improved graphics.
  > Fixed some maps being drawn off center (most commonly Sonoma).

PEDALS:
  > Fixed force feedback in telemetry showing only when turning right.

GEARBOX:

--------------------------------------------
v1.0.6b
GENERAL:
  > Added Setting to manually resize apps.
  > Fixed apps being cut when ui scale is changed.
  > Fixed apps being positioned incorrectly by default when ui scale is changed.

--------------------------------------------
v1.0.6

GENERAL:
  > Apps will resize automatically depending on the content inside it.
    Only exception is the deltabar, after manually resizing the window will adjust itself accordingly. 
  > The first time you open the HUD each app will be placed in their default layout.
    In Settings > General you can find a button to manually reset all apps to their default position.
    If you've used the HUD before each app will not move, you'll have to reset manually.

LEADERBOARD:
  > Fixed overcorrection where leaderboard would display 7 people instead of 6.

TYRES:
  > Fixed inability to gather some data for some more misconfigured cars.
  > Fixed displaying "0 Laps (0.0Km)" for tyre wear when half data is missing, it will now display "No data" instead.
  > Improved calculations for tyre with low End of Life.
  > Improved calculations of grip levels for some cars.
    Previously it might report medium grip at some lapcount, but it would actually be at a higher one.

GEARBOX:
  > In Settings, separated measurements units into distinct switches.
    Previously you would either see speed in KMH and fuel in Liters OR speed in MPH and fuel in gal,
    now you can choose both values indipendently (so you can see KMH and gal or MPH and L).
    Previous settings changes have been kept.

--------------------------------------------
v1.0.5

GENERAL:
  > Apps can now be pinned by right clicking on them.

TYRES:
  > Fixed visualization of misconfigured cars.
    Previously we would use the available data on the misconfigured tyres. Now we do not, meaning tyres will be shown as gray.

MAP:
  > Animation of track color when flag changes.

LEADERBOARD:
  > Fixed incredibly rare case where some people might be drawn more than once.

--------------------------------------------
v1.0.4

DELTABAR:
  > Optimized how lap/sector data is converted and stored in files.
    This should reduce occasional lag spikes, usually visible when finishing a sector.
    On our end saving data in Interlagos is now 20% to 300% (3x) faster. The effect is clearer on longer tracks.
    Old data is NOT lost, it will silently be converted from the old format to the new, you just
    have to re-open a track+car where you had data and we will convert it.
    Because of this we've moved the storage directory, new file data will 
    be saved in Documents/Assetto Corsa/CMRT-Essential-HUD, and each file will be a lap saved.
  > Fix delta jumps when in Session Optimal and Record Optimal and making a new best sector.
    Previously if you had -0.2s at the end of the first sector, the deltabar would jump to 0.0s.
    Now it shouldn't anymore.

RADAR:
  > Added settings to show other players rectangles rotated (off by default).
  > Added settings to show extra warning bands for closest cars (off by default).

PEDALS:
  > Fixed bars getting on top of telemetry/steering wheel at different resolutions when handbrake is enabled.
  > Next time you open the game the app will remember if you have left telemetry open or closed.

TYRES:
  > In integrated Pedals app, fixed bars getting on top of telemetry/steering wheel at different resolutions when handbrake is enabled.

MAP:
  > Increased resolution of drivers circles.

--------------------------------------------
v1.0.3

GEARBOX:
  > Reworked timing of lights.
  > RPM Lights now only light up when near the limiter, instead of starting from 0 RPM.
    You can disable this and re-enable the old system in Settings.
  > Fuel estimate will be saved so next time you open Assetto Corsa you can immediately see it.
  > Fixed position of the RPM Lights being 2 px too much on the right.

LEADERBOARD:
  > At the end of a race moved the "FINISHED" text into the lap count, so you can see the driver latest laptime.
  > At the end of a race the interval between you and each driver is not updated, so you can see how much gap you had.
  > Fixed leaderboard being cut when there's only a couple of people and you want to move the window.

DELTABAR:
  > New layout options: you can decide if you want the delta bar in the middle, on top, or on the bottom of the app.
  > Fixed rare crash when deltabar is in Session Optimal or Record Optimal mode.

--------------------------------------------
v1.0.2
GENERAL:
  > Optimized how data from leaderboard is retrieved, getting about 25% faster.
    Previously to draw/update every app it took 1.62ms (on our end), now it takes 1.26ms (on our end).
  > Added startup animations to Leaderboard, Map, Tyres, Deltabar, Radar, Sectors and Gearbox.
    Animations plays only at game startup and when the window appears on screen.

PEDALS:
  > Optimized app rendering of telemetry, about 2x-3x speedup.
    Previously the app would take about 0.18ms-0.22ms to draw (on our end),
    now it takes about 0.07ms-0.11ms (on our end).
  > You can now choose to display the handbrake (default off, changeable in Settings).
  > Steering wheel indicator turns red if your steering wheel is turned more than
    270 degrees while you're standing still.

DELTABAR:
  > Added Minimized mode (default off, changeable in Settings).
    Hides the delta bar itself, leaving on screen the delta number.
  > Deltabar will now remeber the last mode you have across session.
    In other words, the next time you open the game you will have the same 
    barmode you had when you closed it, unless you set in settings that
    you want something else.
  > Fixed '*' on invalid laps sometimes not being displayed correctly,
    this was most common in the first we laps of races.
  > Laps starting from pitlane are now considered.
    With this it should take only 1 valid lap to start seeing data,
    instead of 2 (when you started from pitlane).
  > Further optimized data usage/storage, most visible on long tracks.
    Previously the app would become slowly slower and slower due to how that data was used.
    Now performance should basically be consistent instead of slowly getting worse and worse.

TYRES:
  > Fixed some "misconfigured" tyres.ini resulting in only half of the tyres being
    colored correctly, while the other half are always "cold".
  > Fixed pressing on the app's upper region not opening the info panel when the app is on the right side of the screen.
  > Fixed info panel opening/closing animations being twitchy.

LEADERBOARD:
  > Improved flag changing detection, resulting in even less quick flag changes.
  > Fixed multiple people having the same sector as purple (visible during practice/qualify).

SECTORS:
  > Fixed purple/green gradient on best time not having the top right corner rounded


--------------------------------------------
v1.0.1
TYRES:
  > fixed app crashes when important data is missing, it should now be seen and tell you the data is missing.
  > improved how we get that data, it should be more stable now, even for cripted cars.

LEADERBOARD:
  > reduced possible flicker on flag changes.

SECTORS:
  > added symbols to indicate invalid current/last laps.
  > increased default notification time from 5 to 8 seconds

DELTABAR:
  > Added setting to save lap/sectors data only when the game closes instead of at the end of each sector.
    This should help you if you notice any stuttering near the end of each sector.
    WARNING: The data will be lost if the game crashes or closes unexpectedly (for example by using Alt+F4).
    In the next updates we will work to reduce the lag, so this setting might not be necessary in the future.

  > fixed notification time not being considered.
  > increased maximum notification time from 20 to 40 seconds.

PEDALS:
  > increased default window size when first opened to show the full telemetry + pedals
